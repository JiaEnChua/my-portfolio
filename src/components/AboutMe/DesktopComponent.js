            I always have a passion for building things and it is until my first
            CS class in Purdue University that introduces me to the world of
            programming. During my time in Purdue, I took part in different
            research opportunities and summer internship to learn more about
            software development.

            I am highly motivated to learn and adapt to fast-changing
            technologies and environments. Shortly after graduation, I join
            Cerner Corporation where I work on a wide spectrum of challenging
            projects ranging from front end design to backend dev as well as
            some 3rd party integrations.
